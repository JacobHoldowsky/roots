This process allows individuals to make sense of and respond appropriately to sensory inputs like touch, sound, sight, taste, and movement. Challenges in sensory processing can lead to difficulties in daily functioning, behavior, and social participation. Our approach includes customized sensory diets, therapeutic activities, and environmental modifications to support sensory integration.",

The therapy aims to address developmental and neurological challenges by working with reflexes that arenâ€™t properly integrated.
