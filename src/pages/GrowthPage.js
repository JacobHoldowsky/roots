            <h2>Sensory Processing and Integration</h2>
            <p>
              Sensory processing and integration is the brain's ability to
              receive, organize, and interpret sensory information from the
              environment and the body. This process allows individuals to make
              sense of and respond appropriately to sensory inputs like touch,
              sound, sight, taste, and movement...

            <p>

              reflex patterns in the nervous system. The therapy aims to address

              that arenâ€™t properly integrated...
